Summary:
The features we found represent a small subset of all the concepts learned by the model during training, and finding a full set of features using our current techniques would be cost-prohibitive (the computation required by our current approach would vastly exceed the compute used to train the model in the first place). Itâ€™s therefore particularly interesting that, in addition to the aforementioned scam emails feature, we found features corresponding to:

Capabilities with misuse potential (code backdoors, developing biological weapons)
Different forms of bias (gender discrimination, racist claims about crime)
Potentially problematic AI behaviors (power-seeking, manipulation, secrecy)
We previously studied sycophancy, the tendency of models to provide responses that match user beliefs or desires rather than truthful ones. Golden Gate Bridge Feature
A feature sensitive to mentions of the Golden Gate Bridge fires on a range of model inputs, from English mentions of the name of the bridge to discussions in Japanese, Chinese, Greek, Vietnamese, Russian, and an image.
